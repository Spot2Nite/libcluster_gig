# A simple libcluster strategy for Google Instance

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed by adding `libcluster_gig` to your list
of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:libcluster_gig, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Setup

This library is using the Google APIs to call various services, and you'll need to provide an access token. Excerpt from
[Google's API docs](https://github.com/googleapis/elixir-google-api), in relation to obtaining an Access Token

### Service Accounts

Authentication is typically done through Application Default Credentials which means you do not have to change the code
to authenticate as long as your environment has credentials. Start by creating a Service Account key file. This file can
be used to authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use the file, set the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path to the key file, for example:

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json
```

If you are deploying to App Engine, Compute Engine, or Container Engine, your credentials will be available by default.

### Usage

In your application supervision tree, add this custom `libcluster` strategy.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    topologies = [
      myapp_release_name: [
        strategy: Cluster.Strategy.GoogleInstanceGroups,
        config: [
          project: "4thehorde",
          zone: "kekw",
          instance_group: "omegalul",
          adapter: Cluster.Strategy.Adapter.InstanceGroups
        ]
      ]
    ]

    children = [
      {Cluster.Supervisor, [topologies, [name: GoogleInstanceGroups.ClusterSupervisor]]}
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, [name: MyApp.Supervisor, strategy: :one_for_one])
  end
end
```

But you can also use a `libcluster` specific configuration. For example:

```elixir
config :libcluster,
  topologies: [
    myapp_release_name: [
      strategy: Cluster.Strategy.GoogleInstanceGroups,
      config: [
        project: "4thehorde",
        zone: "kekw",
        instance_group: "omegalul",
        adapter: Cluster.Strategy.Adapter.InstanceGroups
      ]
    ]
  ]

```

and then add the following to one of your app's supervision trees, as a child

```elixir
  {Cluster.Supervisor,
    [Application.get_env(:libcluster, :topologies), [name: MyApp.ClusterSupervisor]]}

```

That's itâ„¢
